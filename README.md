# Weight-initializations-and-dropout-techniqueto-regularize-the-network

weight initializations: 

1. Initialize the weights to zero
2. Initialize the weights to small random values
3. Initialize the weights to big random values
4. Initialize the weights with Xavierinitializationmethod
5. Initialize the weights with He initialization method
